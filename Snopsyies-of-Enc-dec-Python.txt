Encryption Decryption USING PYTHON---->

1.What is Cryptography ?
Ans. Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure 
     communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.

2. What is Encryption ?
Ans. Encryption is the process of translating (plain-text) into something that appears
     to be random and meningless(cipher-text). For.ex-> hello(plain-text) => (sauyashfaj11!!!)
     (Encrypted or cypher text).

3. What is Decryption ?
Ans. Decryption is the process of converting ciphertext back to plain text.


So Iam Going to make a Tool or Gui With the help of Python's framework called Tkinter,and many other frameworks to 
Name of the TOOL IS.

ENCRYPTED MESSAGE TO DECRYPTED MESSAGE(CYPHER -TO- pLAIN-TEXT).

Let's Start-->

Uses Of This Tool:
1. You can send Your personal message with privacy.
2. no need to get impatient about the message security.
3. Helps you to make plans secretly.

Let's Star-->

Basic Requirement-->
1.Python should be installed in your laptop or PC.
2.install python module pybase64 Using this command in cmd/powershell(/*pip install pybase648*/)

Q. What is pybase64 ?
Ans. (a.)In Python the base64 module is used to encode and decode data.First,the strings are
         Converted into byte-like objects and then encoded using the base64 module. 
	
     (b.)base64 schemes is commonly used whne there is a need to encode binary data that needs
         to be store and transfered over media that are designed to deal with ASCII,
         This is to ensure that data remain intact without modification during transport.  


3.Should Be aware of The concept OF CryptoGraphy or cryotology:
  Explained Above. 


Let's Start--->

=>Basic steps Code will Be Provided in the repository of Git HUB:
  Link will Be mentioned Below:-->

Step 1. import The basic Framework Which we will  used In this Project
